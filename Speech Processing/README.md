# 🗣️ Speech Processing for Azerbaijani

Welcome to the **Speech Processing** repository! This is a collection of my personal projects focused on **fine-tuning and adapting STT (Speech-to-Text)** and **TTS (Text-to-Speech)** models for the **Azerbaijani language**.

## 🎯 Purpose

The aim of this repo is to:
- Explore and fine-tune state-of-the-art speech models for low-resource languages.
- Develop high-quality Azerbaijani speech applications.
- Share training configs, and evaluation tools for reproducibility and community use.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- 🧠 Hugging Face Transformers & Datasets
- 🔊 ESPnet, OpenAI Whisper, Fairseq
- 🐍 Python (PyTorch, NumPy, Librosa, etc.)
- 🎛️ Custom scripts for preprocessing, training, and evaluation

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- 🧠 [Hugging Face Transformers & Datasets](https://huggingface.co/) — for model fine-tuning, tokenization, and dataset handling.
- 🗣️ [finetune-hf-vits](https://github.com/ylacombe/finetune-hf-vits) — a helpful starter for fine-tuning VITS-based TTS models using Hugging Face pipelines.
- 🎼 [Orpheus-TTS](https://github.com/canopyai/Orpheus-TTS) — a high-quality multilingual TTS pipeline, useful for vocoder and synthesis experiments.
- 🐍 Python libraries like `PyTorch`, `NumPy`, `Librosa`, `SoundFile`, and more for core development.
- 🎛️ Custom scripts for audio preprocessing/postprocessing, model training, evaluation, and inference tailored to the Azerbaijani language.


## 📣 Contributing

This is a solo pet project for now, but I welcome:
- Feedback on results and methods
- Suggestions for new datasets or model architectures
- Collaboration on underrepresented language technologies
